                 <h6>Overview</h6>
                 <p  class="p2">Design is changing. The most prominent trend is that design is being recognised by businesses and organizations, and a whole new field is emerging. <br>People often refer to it as service design, a holistic discipline that is core for the Product-Service System Design MSc of Politecnico di Milano University: this research has been carried out by Matteo Remondini between July 2015 and July 2016 as part of the final dissertation tutored by Anna Meroni.<br><br></p>
                 <h6>Objectives</h6>
                 <p  class="p2">The aim of this research is to help clarifying what service design is today, what are the emerging trends and how to contribute to its development as a product-service system designer. This research has been conducted in London, where service design was born and is steadily evolving.<br><br></p>
                 <h6>Methodology</h6>
                 <p  class="p2">To accomplish this task, a discrete quantity of interviews has been carried out in order to highlight and compare some of the industry most relevant personalitiesâ€™ different perspectives on the subject. The interviews have been supported by traditional bibliographic research and constant participation to dedicated events/conferences. All the views expressed in the interviews are personal and do not reflect those of the employees. <br><br></p>
                 <h6>Conclusions</h6>
                 <p  class="p2">Some recurring topics emerged from interviews and desk research, in the making of this study: a conceptual map is provided for each topic, in order to help summarising results and explaining some of the most relevant trends.<br>The transcribed interviews are published on this website that let users filter and quickly compare different opinions on the topics they are more interested in.<br><br>The full report, which includes the theoretical part, bibliography and references - and the transcripts of the interviews is publicly available.</p>
